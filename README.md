# Piglet Run
In a meat processing factory a piglet is on the run whilst being hunted down by a butcher. The piglet's objective is to reach the end of the factory without being caught to be set free. The butcher's objective is to catch up to the piglet before the piglet can reach the end. While both users commense their race there will be obstacles in their way to slow both users down and create an equal opportunity.

## MVP Goals
* Render a starting menu page
* Within menu page give options that would include starting game, checking how many times a user wins, instruction guide
* Render game page with piglet and butcher
* Render borders, static obstacles, and moving obstacles that either user can't move through
* Allow both users to move around using (wasd) and (up,down,left, right) keys
* Create logic to check if butcher catches up to piglet and wins
* Create logic to check if piglet makes it to the end before being caught and win



## Stretch Goals
* Keep track of how many wins each user has
* Before starting game, give an option to users to select different characters 
* If enough time available, create more than one level/setting of the game

## Potential Roadblocks
* Might encounter issues with users pressing their selected keys at the same time
* Might have some issues with animating and allowing jumps/falls
